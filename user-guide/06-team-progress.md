## Identifying Bottlenecks

### Warning Signs

| Indicator | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| 🔴 Many stuck tasks | Process issues | Review blocking dependencies |
| ⚠️ High wait times | Capacity problems | Redistribute work |
| 📊 Uneven distribution | Load imbalance | Reassign tasks |
| 🕐 Overdue tasks | Timeline issues | Extend or escalate |

### Common Bottleneck Causes

1. **Single Point of Failure**
   - One person blocking multiple tasks
   - Solution: Cross-train team members

2. **Unclear Dependencies**
   - Tasks locked unexpectedly
   - Solution: Review playbook design

3. **Resource Constraints**
   - Not enough people for the work
   - Solution: Hire or prioritize

4. **External Dependencies**
   - Waiting on outside parties
   - Solution: Set expectations, escalate

When someone is overloaded:
1. Identify their available tasks
2. Find team members with capacity
3. Reassign tasks
4. Notify both parties

### Adjusting Timelines

When deadlines are unrealistic:
1. Review the stuck workflow
2. Assess remaining work
3. Extend due dates if needed
4. Communicate changes

### Escalating Issues

When you can't resolve a blocker:
1. Document the issue
2. Notify your manager/owner
3. Propose solutions
4. Follow up on resolution
