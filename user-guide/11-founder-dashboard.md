![KPI Metrics](../screenshots/founder/kpi-metrics.png)
*Key Performance Indicators at a glance*

| Metric | Description | What to Watch |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Task Completion Rate** | % of tasks completed on time | Below 80% indicates process issues |
| **Team Workload** | Tasks per user, highlighting max/min | Uneven distribution needs attention |
| **Bottlenecks** | Tasks stuck or overdue | High count requires immediate action |
| **Avg. Workflow Duration** | Time from start to completion | Increasing trends need investigation |

### Understanding the Metrics

**Task Completion Rate**
- Calculated as: `(Completed on time / Total completed) * 100`
- Green (90%+): Excellent
- Yellow (70-89%): Needs attention
- Red (below 70%): Critical

**Team Workload**
- Shows distribution of active tasks across team members
- Highlights who's overloaded and who has capacity
- Useful for reassignment decisions

**Bottlenecks**
- Counts tasks with `stuck` or `overdue` status
- Click to drill down into specific blocked items
- Often indicates process or assignment issues

## Filtering & Analysis

### Three-Level Filtering

Use filters to focus on specific segments of your organization:

![Filter Options](../screenshots/founder/team-filter-open.png)
*Filter dropdown showing team selection options*

| Filter | Options | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **By Team** | Creative, Accounts, Development, Marketing | Department-specific analysis |
| **By Project** | Nexus Rebrand, Stellar Launch | Project-level oversight |
| **By Client** | Nexus Corporation, Stellar Finance | Client-specific reviews |

### Date Range Selection

Analyze performance over different time periods:

- **Today**: Daily standup preparation
- **This Week**: Weekly team meeting
- **This Month**: Monthly business review
- **Custom Range**: Specific period analysis

---

## Meeting View

Toggle between **Overview** and **Meeting View** for presentation-ready displays.

### Overview Mode (Default)

Full dashboard with all metrics and detailed breakdowns.

### Meeting View Mode

Simplified display optimized for screen sharing:
- Larger fonts and cleaner layout

- Highlights and concerns summary
- Upcoming deadlines list

**Ideal for:**
- Daily standups (Today filter)
- Weekly team meetings (Week filter)
- Monthly business reviews (Month filter)
- Client progress updates (Client filter)

---

## Best Practices

### Daily Routine

1. **Morning check** - Review bottlenecks first thing
2. **Identify blocks** - Address stuck tasks immediately
3. **Balance workload** - Reassign if someone's overloaded

### Weekly Review

1. **Compare to last week** - Identify trends
2. **Celebrate wins** - Acknowledge top performers
3. **Address patterns** - Recurring bottlenecks need process changes

### Monthly Analysis

1. **Client health** - Review completion rates by client
2. **Team capacity** - Adjust hiring or allocation
3. **Process improvements** - Update playbooks based on data

### Red Flags to Watch

| Signal | Possible Cause | Action |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Completion rate dropping | Process too complex | Simplify playbooks |
| One person always overloaded | Poor distribution | Redistribute or hire |
| Same task type always stuck | Training gap | Provide support/training |
| Client workflows delayed | Unclear requirements | Improve intake process |
